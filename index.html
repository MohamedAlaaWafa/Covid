                        <p>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</p>
                        <p>It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan,
                            Hubei, China.

                            Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath
                            and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe
                            acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

                            Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                            mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close
                            contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratoryillness such as coughing and sneezing</p>
